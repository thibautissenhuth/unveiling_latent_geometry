Code for the paper: [Unveiling the Latent Space Geometry of Push-Forward Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10541).

## Guidance
In TransGAN_simplicial, find the code to run the experiments on TransGAN with a simplicial cluster latent space.

In latent_space_geometry, find the code to run ResNet GANs and our metrics analysing the latent space geometry of GANs: LogReg Accuracy and Convex Accuracy.
